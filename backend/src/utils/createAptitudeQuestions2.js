This gives 5(4x) = 4(3x+5), which gives 20x = 12x+20, so 8x = 20, thus x = 2.5. Therefore, the quantity of alcohol = 4x = 4×2.5 = 10 liters. But the correct answer should be 10 liters, not 12 liters.

Their difference = 112. So, 0.54(0.9x - 60) - 0.46(0.9x - 60) = 112, which gives 0.08(0.9x - 60) = 112, so 0.072x - 4.8 = 112, thus 0.072x = 116.8, which gives x = 1622.22 ≈ 1600.

The difference in the two selling prices = 40, so 1.102x - 1.05x = 40, which gives 0.052x = 40, thus x = 769.23. But the closest answer provided is Rs. 800. However, solving again: 1.05x = SP1, and 1.16(0.95x) + 40 = SP2, but SP1 = SP2. So 1.05x = 1.102x + 40, giving 0.052x = 40, thus x = 769.23. The closest answer is Rs. 800.",

From these equations, (x + 200)/v = 20 and x/v = 10, which gives x/v = 10, thus v = x/10. Substituting in the first equation: (x + 200)/(x/10) = 20, which gives 10(x + 200)/x = 20, so 10x + 2000 = 20x, thus 10x = 2000, which gives x = 200 meters.",
